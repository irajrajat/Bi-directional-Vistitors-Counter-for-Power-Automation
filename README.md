# Bi-directional-Vistitors-Counter-for-Power-Automation
 The aim of this project is to make a model based on a microcontroller to count the number of people entering a mall then enable the required number of motors or engines based on the number of people inside the mall using Proteus Simulation Software. he project is a real-life model capable of carrying out the mission of counting in both directions. Not only will it raise the counter when any individual enters the mall through the entry, but also when any person exits the mall through the exit, the value of the counter decreases accordingly.
